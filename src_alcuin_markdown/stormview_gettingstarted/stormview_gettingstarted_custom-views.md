# Custom views in StormView {#c_mv_customize_views .concept}

In the **Customize Views** page, you can query a range of different entities in order to analyze different aspects of your project and associated cluster activity. You can analyze the tasks, targets, and clusters associated with your project. This allows you to gain more powerful insights into the status and progress of your project.

There are a variety of existing data analysis tasks available for constructing your queries or you can develop your own. Once you have developed your custom data view, you can save, print, or export the results.

|**Analysis Pane**|Displays the returned results. The data will be displayed differently and different commands will be available, depending on the type of data analyzed and the types of queries enacted.|
