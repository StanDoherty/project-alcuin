# System performance {#c_mv_performance_tab .concept}

The **System Performance Tab** provides a data view of your project's progress towards its targets. Using the **Data View** widget in the top right hand corner, you can manipulate the data stream:

-   Change the time period displayed using the \(insert time period icon\) icon.
-   Select different tasks to see how specific aspects of your project are progressing using the \(insert task icon\) icon.

You can use the real-time System Performance readings to better manage your project and subordinate tasks.

Monitoring **System Performance**

The **System Performance** tab provides the ability to monitor the performance of selected cluster hosts and specific processing jobs. In order to facilitate this, the **System Performance** tab provides simple mechanisms for selecting **active jobs** \(tasks\), setting the **time period** within which analysis and reporting will occur, and the type of **graphical layout** and **event type** will be applied.

-   **Active Jobs** Analysis
    -   Based on the **Active Clusters** selected in the **Workspace** view, the subordinate active jobs will be displayed.
    -   The data stream in the data view will be updated to reflect the active jobs selected.
    -   These settings will be maintained until changed.
    -   These settings can be saved for later use or shared with colleagues.
-   **Time Periods**
    -   Use the **Time Period** controls in the **System Performance** view to constrain the analysis being performed to a specific time period.
    -   Use the date controls to set a start and end time for the analysis window.
        -   When you select a date control, a **Calendar View** will open.
        -   Within the **Calendar View**, start and end dates can be chosen.
        -   The **Calendar View** provides fields for designating specific start and end times.
        -   The **Calendar View** provides the option to define rules that will be used to automatically select date and time ranges.
    -   The data stream in the data view will be updated to reflect the time period selected.
    -   These settings will be maintained until changed.
    -   These settings can be saved for later use or shared with colleagues.
