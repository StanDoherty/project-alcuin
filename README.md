# Project Alcuin
Alcuin of Northumbria (England) was an 8th-Century CE scholar, mathematician, college administrator, and close political advisor to King Charlemagne the Great. At each phase of his long career, Alcuin mastered the writing and speaking skills necessary to succeed -- whether he was developing a theological treatise, defining a curriculum for the Palace School of Charlemagne, or distributing political tracts against the religious persecution of non-Christians. By virtue of his influence in each field, he inspired a level of collaboration and coordination across institutions that was unparalleled in his day.
