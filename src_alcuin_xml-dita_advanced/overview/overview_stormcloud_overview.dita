        <p><ph conkeyref="library_productname_keys/k_ph_cloud"/> provides a set of interfaces to the
            following Cloud-specific services:</p>
        <ul id="ul_erp_rt1_v1b">
            <li><i>Cloud client interfaces</i>: The access and security interfaces required to allow
                web clients, mobile apps, or dedicated management applications to interact with
                Cloud services. </li>
            <li><i>Cloud storage</i>: The storage interfaces that allow multiple clients to access
                stored objects, be they physically residing on a public cloud, private cloud, or
                hybrid cloud. The cloud storage needs to be agile, flexible, scalable, multi-tenant,
                and secure.</li>
            <li><i>Service-oriented delivery</i>:  The logical interfaces necessary to allow
                Cloud-based services to become available to multiple clients and tenants â€“ Software
                as a service (SaaS), Development as a service (DaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS),
                and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). </li>
        </ul>
